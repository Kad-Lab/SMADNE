This repository contains the files required to convert kymograph data into video of moving objects. Only a single object can be created in each video, and the required format for the kymograph is the mean position in a column. To extract such data from a kymograph you can fit the data to a Gaussian profile (as an estimate of the PSF for the fluorophore) using this imageJ (or FIJI) macro: https://github.com/Kad-Lab/ImageJ/blob/main/Gaussian_Fit%20extra.txt
